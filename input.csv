Accounts,"Where do I find my balance?
How do I find out how much money I have?","The most current record we have about the funds that are available for withdrawal for your account. Your available balance includes: all deposits and withdrawals we have posted to your account; pending withdrawals; and a portion or all of your check deposits made at a WorldFinancial location, ATM, or through WorldFinancial Mobile deposit"
Accounts,"What is not included in my available balance?
What is left out of my balance?","Pending check deposits that have not yet been processed or posted to your account or those that did not receive availability at the time we received the deposit. These funds will be available on the next business day, unless a hold is placed. If a hold is placed on the deposit, generally $200 is available the next business day and the remaining funds will be available when the hold is removed.
Outstanding checks and automatic payments you have authorized (such as car payments, a gym membership, or other recurring debit card transactions) that have not yet been received by us for payment.
Debit card transactions authorized by us but not submitted by the merchant for payment within three business days of authorization, or that were never submitted for authorization.
Final transaction amounts for some debit card transactions may be greater than the amount initially authorized (a common occurrence at restaurants where a tip may not appear on the amount initially authorized, but will appear on the final transaction amount). For more details, see ""What other factors affect my available balance?"" below.

To avoid overspending, it��s a good idea to keep a personal record of your transactions, and compare your record to what you see as your Available Balance with WorldFinancial Online."

You will see the Account Activity screen with a list of your transactions, starting with the most recent."
Accounts,"How is my available balance calculated?
What is the calculation for balance?","We begin with your current posted balance and then adjust for any holds on recent deposits and any pending transactions that are known to the bank.

Current posted balance includes:

Deposits and withdrawals that have been posted to your account by the end of the previous business day.
Pending transactions include:

Deposits you made after the previous business day (during the day or over a weekend, for example).
ATM withdrawals, WorldFinancial Online Bill Pay transactions, and pending debit card transactions that have been authorized but not yet paid from your account.
Checks and automatic payments received by the bank during the day, which have not yet been fully processed (posted) for payment.  Examples of automatic payments are bills you pay by authorizing a third party to obtain the funds directly from your account. Please note: If there is not enough money to cover these transactions during the nightly processing, we may pay the item creating an overdraft or return the item unpaid."
Accounts,"How much account activity can I view online?
How much account history can I view?","The amount of history you can view through WorldFinancial Online depends on your type of account:

Checking, savings, and money market account histories are available with WorldFinancial Online for up to 18 months.
Line of credit and installment loan account histories are available with WorldFinancial Online for up to 24 months.
Credit card account histories are available with WorldFinancial Online for up to 90 days or 300 transactions.
If you need information prior to these times, please refer to your account statement. You can view or request a previous statement through WorldFinancial Online, or you can access Statements and Disclosures through the More menu if you are already signed on."
Accounts,"Why was a hold placed on my deposit?
What is the reason for the hold on my deposit?","In some cases it may be necessary to place a hold on your deposit. The first $200 is usually available the next business day, but the rest may not be available for several days. If you have questions about a hold that we placed on your deposit, please call 1-800-869-3557."
Accounts,"Why are my available and posted balances different?
Why are my balances different?","Your available balance is the most current record we have about the funds that are available for withdrawal from your account.

It includes all deposits and withdrawals that have been posted to your account and it is adjusted throughout the day as we authorize or receive notice of pending transactions.

Your posted balance is your account balance at the end of the last business day. A business day is generally Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. The ending balance does not include any pending transactions that have occurred since the close of the previous business day."
Accounts,"What are pending transactions?
Can you explain pending transactions?","Pending transactions are transactions that are known to WorldFinancial but have not yet been fully processed (posted) for payment from your account.

For some debit card transactions, the amount you see listed when the transaction is pending may not be the final amount deducted from your account; for example it may not include a tip you might add to a restaurant bill.

Please note that pending transactions may not post to your account in the order listed."
Accounts,"How can I keep track of my available balance?
How do I track my balance?","Keep a record of all of your transactions and compare your record to what is reflected by the bank.

Adjust your record to include outstanding checks and automatic payments you have authorized (such as car payments, a gym membership, or other recurring debit card transactions) but have not yet been received by the bank.

You can find details about your pending and posted transactions when you view your account activity through WorldFinancial Online."
Accounts,"What other factors affect my available balance?
What else affects my balance?","Debit card purchases
If you make a purchase with your debit card, the merchant may request authorization for an initial amount and send us the actual transaction amount later for payment. This is often the case in places where you can add a tip to your bill (such as restaurants or salons), hotels and car rental agencies, where there can be a significant difference between the amount that's authorized initially (authorization hold amount) and the actual transaction amount. The initially authorized amount appears in your pending transactions, but the actual transaction amount is deducted from your account.

For most debit card purchases, we receive the payment request, including the actual transaction amount, within three (3) business days of the transaction. If we don't receive a final payment request from the merchant within three (3) business days, [or up to thirty (30) business days for certain types of debit or ATM card transactions including but not limited to car rental transactions, cash transactions, and international transactions], we release the authorization hold on the transaction. We then remove the transaction from your list of pending transactions and add the funds back to your available balance.

If we receive the payment request at a later date, the actual transaction amount will be deducted from your account at that time. Keep track of your transactions and ensure you have sufficient funds in your accounts to cover the final payment.

Deposits
Cash deposits and transfers from another WorldFinancial account are immediately available for your use. In addition, a pending cash deposit or transfer from another WorldFinancial account made after the displayed cutoff time (where the deposit was made) will be used to pay your transactions if it is made before we start our nightly process on business day (generally Monday-Friday, except federal holidays).

A portion or all of your check deposits made at a WorldFinancial location or ATM may be immediately available for your use on the day of the deposit, unless a hold is placed. Funds not available on the day of the deposit will be available the next business day or after any applicable holds are removed. A check deposit made before the displayed cutoff time (where the deposit was made) will be used by us to pay your transactions in our nightly process. Occasionally, a hold will be placed which prevents withdrawal of the money until a later date.  Further details are provided in our Funds Availability Policy in the Account Agreement."
Accounts,"When will my deposit be credited to my account?
When will my deposit be in my account?","If you make your deposit before the displayed banking location, ATM, or mobile banking cut-off time on a business day, we will generally credit the deposit to your account the same business day. If you make your deposit after the cut-off time or on a non-business day, we will credit it to your account on the next business day.

Business days are Monday through Friday, except for federal holidays.
Cut-off times are displayed in all locations. The cut-off time for most WorldFinancial ATM locations is 9 pm local time. The cut-off time for deposits using the WorldFinancial mobile banking app is 9 pm Pacific Time.
Use our locator to find the cut-off times for a banking location or ATM nearest you.
"
Accounts,"Why has a debit card purchase not posted to my account?
Why hasn't my purchase shown up in my account?","WorldFinancial cannot post your debit card transaction until the merchant submits the transaction to us for payment. A few things to keep in mind:

Generally debit card transactions post within 1-3 days of when you make the purchase. However, the timing of when a debit card transaction will post can vary from the very same day to several weeks later.
In rare circumstances such as using your debit card online to buy an item that is back-ordered, the merchant can submit the transaction up to several weeks later.
Because of this, it��s important you keep track of your account balance2 and pending card transactions, scheduled bill payments, checks written, and more, to ensure that you have adequate funds in your account to cover pending items."
Accounts,"What if there are unauthorized charges on my card?
What if there is fraud on my card?","Your WorldFinancial credit card is automatically covered by Zero Liability at no extra cost.

Accounts,"What if I have a dispute with a merchant?

Please refer to the appropriate card terms and conditions for details regarding your responsibility to notify us of disputes within specific time frames."

Accounts,"How do I track my spending?
How do I manage my expenses?","Why it is important
If you are trying to get your finances on track, a good first step is to know how you are spending your money. Here are 3 steps to help you maximize every dollar you earn:

Find out where your money is going. Add up your monthly bills, such as your mortgage or rent, insurance, utilities and phone. Then, track your personal expenses, such as groceries, gas, clothes, even coffee and snacks.
Put your money where it matters most. Ensure you have enough money to cover your needs first, like paying your bills, paying down debt, and adding money to savings.
Review your needs. As you review your expenses, consider whether an expense is something you need or something you want. This step will help you find areas to reduce your spending and find ways to save. If you find you don��t have enough money to cover your spending and allow for savings each month, think about ways to reduce your spending on the things you don��t need.

Card Information,How do the Rewards Credit Cards work if I elect to deposit my rewards in a tax-advantaged IRA or a 529 plan at WorldFinancial?,"Here are some things to keep in mind if you want to deposit your WorldFinancial Rewards into these accounts:All IRA and 529 plan contributions resulting from the card will be considered current-year contributions.

Consult your tax advisor concerning tax consequences.Prior to accepting the transfer of points from Elan Financial Services, WorldFinancial will check to verify whether you have reached your maximum contribution amount with WorldFinancial for that year. If we determine that a customer has fully contributed to his or her WorldFinancial IRA accounts for that year or reached the maximum contribution limit on his or her WorldFinancial-managed 529 plan account, WorldFinancial will not accept the points transfer, and the customer�۪s points will continue to accrue at Elan Financial Services.
