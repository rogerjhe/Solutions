This is often the case in places where you can add a tip to your bill (such as restaurants or salons), hotels and car rental agencies, where there can be a significant difference between the amount that's authorized initially (authorization hold amount) and the actual transaction amount. The initially authorized amount appears in your pending transactions, but the actual transaction amount is deducted from your account.\n\nFor most debit card purchases, we receive the payment request, including the actual transaction amount, within three (3) business days of the transaction. If we don't receive a final payment request from the merchant within three (3) business days, [or up to thirty (30) business days for certain types of debit or ATM card transactions including but not limited to car rental transactions, cash transactions, and international transactions], we release the authorization hold on the transaction. We then remove the transaction from your list of pending transactions and add the funds back to your available balance.\n\nIf we receive the payment request at a later date, the actual transaction amount will be deducted from your account at that time. Keep track of your transactions and ensure you have sufficient funds in your accounts to cover the final payment.\n\nDeposits\nCash deposits and transfers from another WorldFinancial account are immediately available for your use.

        "content": "Here are some things to keep in mind if you want to deposit your WorldFinancial Rewards into these accounts:All IRA and 529 plan contributions resulting from the card will be considered current-year contributions. The ability to contribute to an IRA or 529 college savings plan account is subject to IRS rules and specific program policies, including those on eligibility and annual and maximum contribution limits.To the extent that you are not eligible to make an IRA or 529 plan contribution or have already made your maximum IRA or 529 plan contribution for the year, any additional contributions can subject you to IRS excise taxes. It is your responsibility to ensure that any deposits to your WorldFinancial account are eligible contributions and do not violate the terms of your WorldFinancial accounts, applicable IRS contribution rules, or limitations or other applicable laws or regulations. Consult your tax advisor concerning tax consequences.Prior to accepting the transfer of points from Elan Financial Services, WorldFinancial will check to verify whether you have reached your maximum contribution amount with WorldFinancial for that year. If we determine that a customer has fully contributed to his or her WorldFinancial IRA accounts for that year or reached the maximum contribution limit on his or her WorldFinancial-managed 529 plan account, WorldFinancial will not accept the points transfer, and the customer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00db\u00aas points will continue to accrue at Elan Financial Services. Customers can continue to let points accrue until the next year, or they can redeem these points for other rewards, such as travel, merchandise, gift cards or a statement credit.Under IRS rules, individuals who do not have earned income are generally not eligible to make IRA contributions. Spousal IRAs are not eligible.IRS rules also prohibit IRA contributions from being made to Traditional and Rollover IRAs for the year an IRA owner reaches age 70\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd_ and beyond.If you are also making contributions to another company\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00db\u00aas IRA, WorldFinancial is unable to monitor whether you have maximized your total annual IRA contributions, nor will we be able to stop the reward contribution from going to your WorldFinancial IRA."
